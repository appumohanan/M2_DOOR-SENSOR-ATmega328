# Requirements

## Introduction
* I have done this project with my basic knowledge on embedded c 
* For this project embedded c language is used 
* And basic knowledge of ATmega328 architecture  is needed.
## RESEARCH

- Door sensor will sense if there anyone present or not.
- Modular Approach.

## SWOT- Strengths, and Weakness, Opportunities Threats

# 4W's and 1'H
## Who:  
This Device can be used by anyone, It is easy to use .
## What:
The Temperature measurement using atmega328 is capable of maintaining the proper temperature inside the bus what this system will do it will sense the temperature inside the Bus using temperature sensor (LM 35) and it will give the signal to fan which will get switched ONN and Off accourding to requirement  .
## When:
It is made as a part of LTTS Step-in Mini Project work.
## Where:
It's made using Visual Studio Code IDE on Windows 10.
## How:
A simple algorithm is used which has a simple Temperature measurement code and can analyse the input and give the result.
